# Job Analysis: Initial Data Exploration & Visualization

Welcome to the initial analysis and visualization phase of the Job Analysis Project! This Jupyter Notebook explores LinkedIn job postings data for 2024. The goal is to uncover trends and insights that can inform further development of the project.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we analyze job posting data to find interesting patterns and insights. This analysis serves as a foundation for the interactive web app we'll create later.

### Key Insights & Visualizations

6. **Conversion Rates (Views vs. Applications)** 👀
   - Looked at how many views job postings get compared to applications to see which ones are most appealing.
